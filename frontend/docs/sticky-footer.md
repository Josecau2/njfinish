# Sticky Footer Implementation

Date: (auto-generated)

## Summary
The application footer is now always anchored at the bottom of the viewport on desktop and mobile, without overlapping content and without using fixed positioning.

## How It Works
`AppShell` now renders the footer inside a Flex container with `direction="column"` and `minH="100vh"`. The content wrapper uses `flex="1"`, pushing `AppFooter` to the bottom when page content height is shorter than the viewport.

```jsx
<Flex direction="column" minH="100vh">
  <AppHeader />
  <Box flex="1"> ...content... </Box>
  <AppFooter />
</Flex>
```

## Removed Redundancy
`DefaultLayout` previously rendered `<AppFooter />` after `<AppShell />`. That usage was removed to avoid duplicate footers.

## Adjustments
- To add spacing above the footer, add `mt={8}` (or similar) on `<AppFooter />` or a padding-bottom on the main content area.
- For a footer that overlays content (not recommended), you would revert to fixed positioningâ€”but current approach is layout-safe and responsive.

## Testing Notes
No runtime JS required; pure layout CSS via Chakra props. Works for both desktop and mobile breakpoints.
