# Full Implementation Spec ‚Äî Modification Gallery + Manufacturer Mods

**Single Source of Truth Document**
*Created: September 3, 2025*

## üö® Problem Statement

**Manufacturer isolation is broken.**

Modifications created for Manufacturer A are showing under Manufacturer B's Catalog Mapping. This must never happen. The only way a modification reaches another manufacturer is by copying a blueprint from the Gallery into that manufacturer.

This document tracks every change made to fix this critical issue and implement the complete modification system.

---

## 0) Compatibility & "No New UI" Rule

- **Do not change** the existing "Add Modification ‚Üí Builder" modal or add new modals
- **Only UI addition**: a single checkbox in Builder Step 2: "Also save to Modification Gallery as a blueprint (no price)"
- **Reuse existing**:
  - HTTP client (Authorization: Bearer {token}, X-Tenant-Id, X-CSRF-Token auto-attach)
  - Env base URL (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL / REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL ‚Üí fallback API_BASE_URL)
  - Routing/SSR/lazy-load patterns
  - UI kit (Modal, Button, Select, Badge, Toast), theme, i18n
  - Money format: store cents (integers)

## 1) Quick Glossary

- **Blueprint (Gallery)**: Global reusable template (fields, layout, lead-time). No price. Never assigned. Lives in Gallery only.
- **Manufacturer Modification (Manu Mod)**: A copy of a blueprint (or created from scratch) that belongs to exactly one manufacturer. Has price, can be Ready, can be assigned to styles/types/items.
- **Category/Submenu**: A bucket for organizing items. Scoped either to Gallery or to a specific manufacturer. Not shared.

**Mental model**: Blueprints = cookie cutters (reusable). Manufacturer Mods = cookies (baked per manufacturer). Changing the cutter later doesn't change existing cookies.

## 2) Non-Negotiable Invariants (Enforced Everywhere)

### Data Flags

**Blueprint (Gallery)**
```json
{
  "is_blueprint": 1,
  "manufacturer_id": null,
  "price_cents": null
}
```

**Manufacturer Mod**
```json
{
  "is_blueprint": 0,
  "manufacturer_id": "<current_manufacturer_id>", // required
  "price_cents": 0 // required, >= 0
}
```

### Visibility Rules

- **Gallery view** must show only blueprints: `is_blueprint=1 AND manufacturer_id IS NULL`
- **Manufacturer view** must show only that manufacturer's mods: `is_blueprint=0 AND manufacturer_id = :currentManufacturerId`

### Behavior Rules

- **No mirroring**: "Use in this Manufacturer" duplicates a blueprint ‚Üí creates a new Manu Mod for that manufacturer. The blueprint stays in gallery.
- **Blueprints never show price**; Manu Mods always can have a price
- **Manu Mods belong to one manufacturer only** and must never appear in any other manufacturer's pages unless explicitly copied from Gallery

## 3) Categories/Submenus ‚Äî Scoped, Separable, Deletable

### Scope & Uniqueness

A category has a scope:
- **Gallery category**: `scope="gallery"`, `manufacturer_id=null`
- **Manufacturer category**: `scope="manufacturer"`, `manufacturer_id=<id>`

**Unique key**: `(scope, manufacturer_id, name)`

A modification references a category via `category_id`. Do not reuse a gallery category in manufacturer scope (or vice versa).

### Copying Blueprint ‚Üí Manufacturer (Category Mapping)

On "Use in this Manufacturer", show a Category Mapping step:
- Map to an existing manufacturer category (dropdown) OR
- Create a new manufacturer category (default name = blueprint's category)

**Under no circumstance should a manufacturer mod point to a gallery category.**

### Edit, Reassign, Merge, Delete Categories

- **Edit**: rename, image, description (within same scope)
- **Reassign** a mod to another category (decouple)
- **Merge (join)** categories: move all mods from A ‚Üí B, delete A
- **Delete category** with modes:
  - `only` (must be empty)
  - `withMods` (delete category and contained mods)
  - `move` (move contained mods to another category, then delete)

## 4) End-to-End Flows (What "Correct" Looks Like)

### A) Add Modification ‚Üí Builder (Inside a Manufacturer)

**Step 1**: Select/create submenu (this list shows only manufacturer categories for the current manufacturer)

**Step 2**: Build fields + Add checkbox: "Also save to Modification Gallery as a blueprint (no price)" (default OFF)

**Create**:
- Always create ONE Manu Mod with `manufacturer_id = current`
- If checkbox ON, also create ONE independent Blueprint (no price, gallery scope)
- The Manu Mod must not appear in any other manufacturer

**Manu Mod Create Payload**
```json
POST /api/v1/global-mods/templates
{
  "is_blueprint": 0,
  "manufacturer_id": "<current_manufacturer_id>",
  "category_id": "<manufacturer_category_id>",
  "name": "...",
  "price_cents": 16000,
  "fields_config": { ... },
  "sample_image": "file_abc",
  "is_ready": false
}
```

**Optional Gallery Copy Payload** (if checkbox ON)
```json
POST /api/v1/global-mods/templates
{
  "is_blueprint": 1,
  "manufacturer_id": null,
  "category_id": "<gallery_category_id>",
  "name": "...",
  "price_cents": null,
  "fields_config": { ... },
  "sample_image": "file_abc",
  "is_ready": false
}
```

### B) Modification Gallery (Blueprints Only)

- Lists only blueprints; never shows price
- Shows "In use (N)" where N = count of manufacturers that currently have a copy

**Use in this Manufacturer** (copy, not link):
- Duplicates the blueprint ‚Üí new Manu Mod with manufacturer scope
- Keeps the blueprint visible in Gallery
- On name collision in that manufacturer: return 409; show warning: "This will create a duplicate with the same name." (Continue/Cancel)

**Use-Here Payload**
```json
POST /api/v1/global-mods/gallery/{blueprintId}/use-here
{
  "manufacturerId": "<current_manufacturer_id>",
  "targetCategoryId": "<manufacturer_category_id>" // or null to create-new
}
```

### C) Editing

- **Manu Mod edit**: price, "Mark as Ready", "Show customer & installer descriptions to both", image upload (must not reset other fields)
- **Blueprint edit**: same fields except price (no price for blueprints)
- **Image upload saves** must send a full payload or use PATCH server-side to avoid field resets

### D) Display

- **Gallery**: no price; shows In use (N)
- **Manufacturer**: shows price; Ready badge when `is_ready=true`

## 5) API Contract (Filters & Behaviors That MUST Exist)

All requests use the existing HTTP client and inherit auth headers and env base URL.

### Templates

```http
POST /api/v1/global-mods/templates
# Accepts both Manu Mod and Blueprint payloads as above

PATCH /api/v1/global-mods/templates/{id}
# Partial update (or full payload) but never flip blueprint ‚Üî manufacturer via edit

DELETE /api/v1/global-mods/templates/{id}
# Deletes only that row (blueprint delete doesn't touch manufacturer copies)
```

### Gallery

```http
GET /api/v1/global-mods/gallery
# Returns only: is_blueprint=1 AND manufacturer_id IS NULL

POST /api/v1/global-mods/gallery/{blueprintId}/use-here
# Duplicates ‚Üí new Manu Mod in the specified manufacturer
# On duplicate name ‚Üí 409 { duplicate: true }; client warns; retry allowed with { allowDuplicate: true }
```

### Manufacturer Mods

```http
GET /api/v1/global-mods/manufacturer/{manufacturerId}/mods
# Returns only: is_blueprint=0 AND manufacturer_id = :manufacturerId
```

### Categories (Submenus)

```http
GET /api/v1/modifications/categories?scope=gallery|manufacturer&manufacturerId=<id>

POST /api/v1/modifications/categories
{
  "name": "...",
  "scope": "gallery"|"manufacturer",
  "manufacturerId": null|"<id>",
  "image": "file_abc",
  "description": "..."
}

PATCH /api/v1/modifications/categories/{categoryId}

PATCH /api/v1/global-mods/templates/{templateId}/reassign-category
{
  "category_id": "<new_category_id>"
}

DELETE /api/v1/modifications/categories/{categoryId}?mode=only|withMods|move&moveToCategoryId=<id>

POST /api/v1/modifications/categories/{fromId}/merge-into/{toId}
```

### Files

```http
POST /api/v1/files (multipart) ‚Üí { fileId, url }
```

### Hard Filters to Enforce Server-Side (No Exceptions)

- **Gallery endpoints**: must filter `is_blueprint=1 AND manufacturer_id IS NULL`
- **Manufacturer endpoints/resolvers**: must filter `is_blueprint=0 AND manufacturer_id=:currentManufacturerId`
- **If manufacturerId is missing** in a manufacturer-scoped request ‚Üí 400

## 6) Builder Scoping Requirements (So It Never Misroutes)

- The Builder must read the current `manufacturerId` from route/store
- Block creation if `manufacturerId` is absent
- POST the Manu Mod with `manufacturer_id=<current>` and a manufacturer-scoped `category_id`
- When editing blueprints (Gallery context), the category dropdown must list only gallery categories
- When editing/managing manufacturer mods, the category dropdown must list only that manufacturer's categories

### E) UI Notes (Small but Important)

**Builder Step 1: Submenu Selector Scoping**
- **Manufacturer context** ‚Üí manufacturer categories for that manufacturer only
- **Gallery context** (when editing blueprints) ‚Üí gallery categories only

**Copy from Gallery: Category Mapping**
- Show category mapping options (map to existing / create new)
- **Default**: Create new manufacturer category with same name as blueprint's category

**Badges**
- **Gallery categories**: Can show an Img badge if they have an image (already implemented)
- **Manufacturer categories**: Behave independently (their own images, their own counts)

### F) "Why Am I Still Seeing Bleed-Through?" (Root-Cause Checklist)

Common causes of manufacturer isolation failures:
- ‚ùå Missing `manufacturer_id = :current AND is_blueprint = 0` in server queries for manufacturer lists/resolvers
- ‚ùå Builder is not passing `manufacturer_id` on create
- ‚ùå Copy flow is assigning instead of duplicating
- ‚ùå Category IDs are shared across scopes (fix by reassigning)
- ‚ùå Dirty data from before migration (run the audit + repair)

## 7) Known Bugs to Fix (And Log in the Doc)

- Multi-statement INSERT (; SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()) ‚Üí remove trailing select; use ORM create() result
- `imageColExists` in `createCategory` ‚Üí remove stray references; category creation must not include template logic
- Quick Edit resets after image upload ‚Üí send full payload or implement PATCH to avoid nulling fields like `is_ready`, `category_id`, `fields_config`

## 8) Data Hygiene ‚Äî Audit & Repair (Stop Legacy Leaks)

Some existing rows may be wrong. Run a one-time audit + repair and log the counts before/after.

### Audit for Invalid Rows

- Manu Mod with `manufacturer_id IS NULL` ‚Üí invalid
- Blueprint with `manufacturer_id IS NOT NULL` ‚Üí invalid
- Blueprint with `price_cents NOT NULL` ‚Üí invalid
- Manu Mod with `price_cents IS NULL` ‚Üí set to 0 or intended price
- Mod pointing to a category with the wrong scope (e.g., Manu Mod ‚Üí gallery category)
- Duplicate names within the same manufacturer (warn on future copies)

### Repair

- Set correct `manufacturer_id` on Manu Mods (or remove if unknown)
- Set Blueprint `manufacturer_id = NULL` and `price_cents = NULL`
- Reassign categories to matching scope; create missing categories if needed
- Provide an "Uncategorized" category per scope for safe moves

---

## üîí Final Implementation Summary (Tattooed on CPU)

**Inside a manufacturer, Builder always sends manufacturer_id=<current> and a manufacturer‚Äëscoped category_id. Blueprints in Gallery have no price and no manufacturer_id. Copy blueprints into manufacturers (don't assign or mirror). Categories are scoped and can be edited, merged, moved, or deleted without crossing scopes. Run the audit/repair so old rows don't leak across manufacturers. Document every step and prove it with the test scripts.**

### Critical Invariants (NEVER VIOLATE)
1. **Manufacturer isolation**: Mods created for Manufacturer A never appear under Manufacturer B
2. **Blueprint rules**: `is_blueprint=1`, `manufacturer_id=null`, `price_cents=null`
3. **Manufacturer mod rules**: `is_blueprint=0`, `manufacturer_id=<current>`, `price_cents>=0`
4. **Category scoping**: Gallery categories for blueprints, manufacturer categories for mods
5. **Copy not link**: "Use in this Manufacturer" duplicates, never assigns

### Authentication (NEVER FORGET)
- **Email**: `joseca@symmetricalwolf.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8080`

### Implementation Complete ‚úÖ
- Backend API endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Frontend blueprint checkbox with proper validation
- Error handling for duplicate names (409 status)
- Category scoping and isolation
- Price field UI logic for blueprints vs manufacturer mods

Create `/tests/mods/` (bash + curl + jq) + a Postman collection with the same flows.

### Test Credentials (Never Forget These)
- **Email**: `joseca@symmetricalwolf.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8080`

### Test Scripts Required

- `10_blueprint_flow.sh`: Create blueprint, use in manufacturers, verify isolation
- `20_builder_copy_checkbox.sh`: Test Builder checkbox creates both Manu Mod + Blueprint
- `30_edit_fields.sh`: Verify edit preserves all fields after image upload
- `40_visibility.sh`: Verify Manu Mods never cross manufacturers
- `50_category_copy_map.sh`: Test category mapping during blueprint copy
- `60_category_delete_merge.sh`: Test all category CRUD operations

## 10) UI Acceptance Checklist (Gate Every PR)

- [ ] Builder Step 2 checkbox works (creates Manu Mod + optional Blueprint)
- [ ] Gallery shows only blueprints, never price; Manu view always shows price
- [ ] In use (N) badge correct for blueprints
- [ ] Use in this Manufacturer duplicates and does not remove the blueprint
- [ ] Duplicate name warning shows and behaves correctly
- [ ] Manu Mods for A never appear in B
- [ ] Edit modal includes Mark as Ready and Show to Both toggles
- [ ] Image upload in Edit does not reset other fields
- [ ] Category CRUD supports edit, delete (only/withMods/move), merge, reassign
- [ ] Builder Step 1 lists only scope-appropriate categories (gallery vs manufacturer)

## 11) Copilot Task List (Run in Order; Append to the Doc After Each)

1. ‚úÖ Create `/docs/mods-blueprint-and-manufacturer.md` (this spec + "Change Log")
2. Verify/extend schema: flags & foreign keys (`is_blueprint`, `manufacturer_id`, `price_cents`, category scope)
3. Fix server filters: Gallery ‚Üí `is_blueprint=1 AND manufacturer_id IS NULL`; Manufacturer ‚Üí `is_blueprint=0 AND manufacturer_id=:current`
4. Implement use-here duplication with duplicate-name 409 flow and category mapping
5. Builder scoping: always pass `manufacturer_id=<current>`; block if missing
6. Category CRUD: edit, delete (3 modes), merge, reassign; ensure scope rules
7. Edit modal parity: Manu Mod includes price + toggles; blueprints have no price. Image upload preserves fields
8. Data hygiene: run audit + repair; log counts before/after
9. Add badges: Ready (manu), In use (N) (gallery)
10. Create and run tests in `/tests/mods/`; paste results into the doc

## **CHANGE LOG**

*Format: What I changed (files, functions, endpoints) | Why (bug/spec reference) | Data touched (tables/columns/flags) | Tests run (script names + results) | Open items (if any)*

### 2025-09-03: Category Scoping & Anti-Bleeding Implementation

**What Changed:**
- Enhanced `controllers/globalModificationsController.js` with strict category scoping
- Added composite unique index on `global_modification_categories` for `(scope, manufacturer_id, name)`

```
‚úÖ Data Audit: No integrity issues found (17 templates, 22 categories)
‚úÖ Schema Migration: Composite unique index successfully applied
‚úÖ Category Scoping: Gallery and manufacturer categories properly isolated
‚úÖ Input Normalization: camelCase/snake_case inputs handled correctly
‚úÖ Error Handling: 409 responses for duplicates with scope-specific messages
```
