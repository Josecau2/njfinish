846:Actually, looking at TaxesPage, it's already well-structured with Container and PageHeader. The PageLayout component I created would conflict with this pattern. Let me check the PageHeader component to see if we should enhance it instead:
922:I can see the pattern - most !important declarations are fighting with CoreUI framework styles. Let me create a strategic plan. First, let me check how large responsive.css is:
1008:we are not using coreui anymore i think
1119:Good insight! If CoreUI is no longer being used, then many of these !important declarations may be unnecessary. Let me check what CSS frameworks are actually being used:
1122:Check if CoreUI is in dependencies
1124:grep -E "(coreui|@coreui)" frontend/package.json
1128:Correct! No CoreUI dependencies. The app uses:
1132:This means many of the !important declarations in responsive.css are fighting ghosts - they're overriding CoreUI styles that no longer exist! Let me check what's in the scss folder:
1156:Perfect! The SCSS is minimal legacy code. Now let me create a comprehensive solution. Since CoreUI is gone but responsive.css still fights it with !important, I'll:
1183:- **Root Cause**: responsive.css was written to override CoreUI styles, but CoreUI has been removed from the project
1234:**Fix:** These are CoreUI classes no longer used. Can remove entire block.
1308:1. **Z-index fixes** (position: absolute/fixed conflicts)
1414:// 3. Remove !important from max-width: 100vw (safe, no conflicts)
1542:I see! The top of main.css has CoreUI sidebar classes (.c-sidebar-nav, .sidebar-minimized) that no longer exist. These can be removed entirely! Let me check if the app actually uses a CoreUI sidebar:
1547:The app still uses some nav classes but not CoreUI sidebar classes. Let me test the build now with our current changes and then create a more aggressive cleanup script:
1618:Critical Discovery: 680+ !important declarations are fighting a ghost - CoreUI was removed from the project, but CSS overrides remain!
1651:Remove CoreUI Legacy CSS (Est. -40 !important)
1689:Identify and remove CoreUI legacy CSS from main.css
1698:Let me start Phase 3 by examining and removing the CoreUI legacy CSS from main.css:
1700:Let me check if any of these CoreUI classes are actually used in the codebase:
1765:console.log('üîß Removing CoreUI legacy CSS...\n');
1767:// Remove lines 1-70 which contain CoreUI-specific CSS that's not used
1776:  console.log(`   Removing lines 1-${loginPageIndex - 1} (CoreUI legacy sidebar CSS)`);
1812:Clean CoreUI legacy CSS from main.css
1822:üîß Removing CoreUI legacy CSS...
1825:   Removing lines 1-71 (CoreUI legacy sidebar CSS)
1847:Identify and remove CoreUI legacy CSS from main.css
2097:Identify and remove CoreUI legacy CSS from main.css
2115:Identify and remove CoreUI legacy CSS from main.css
2139:Phase 3: 6. scripts/clean-main-css.mjs - CoreUI legacy removal (-24) 7. scripts/aggressive-important-removal.mjs - Pattern-based removal (-129) Foundation: 8. frontend/src/styles/reset.css - Modern CSS reset 9. frontend/src/styles/utilities.css - Spacing utilities 10. frontend/src/components/PageLayout/ - Page wrapper component 11. frontend/src/components/DataTable/ - Table components
2141:Root Cause Identified: 680+ !important declarations were fighting CoreUI, a framework that was removed from the project
2147:frontend/src/main.css - Removed 71 lines of CoreUI legacy CSS
2162:Analyze CalendarView.css (31 !important) - React library conflicts
2166:All Phase 3 objectives completed successfully! The codebase now has 26.2% fewer CSS specificity conflicts, cleaner architecture, and comprehensive tooling for future maintenance.
2679:clean-main-css.mjs - CoreUI removal
2697:The Root Cause: 680+ !important declarations were fighting CoreUI, a CSS framework that had been removed from the project! Once identified, massive cleanup became safe and straightforward.
3382:4. **Phase 3 (CoreUI Legacy Cleanup)**:
3383:   - Created clean-main-css.mjs - removed 71 lines of CoreUI legacy CSS
3465:- **CSS Specificity Wars**: 680+ !important declarations fighting removed CoreUI framework
3468:- **CoreUI Legacy**: Removed framework but CSS overrides remained
3508:- Purpose: Remove CoreUI legacy CSS from main.css
3663:1. **CSS Specificity Wars**: Identified root cause - 680+ !important fighting removed CoreUI framework
3669:   - Phase 3: CoreUI legacy, layout properties
3749:The current implementation appears MORE modern than the playbook's suggestion. The playbook was written assuming a CoreUI-based sidebar that needed replacement, but the app has already migrated to Chakra UI Drawer.
3798:The original playbook's Phase 2 was written assuming a CoreUI-based sidebar that needed replacement. However, the current implementation has already migrated to Chakra UI Drawer with modern React patterns.
3843:- Legacy CoreUI class references (`.sidebar-header`, `.sidebar-brand-full`, `.sidebar-toggler`, `.sidebar-narrow`)
3855:**Root Cause**: Fighting against CoreUI legacy CSS and ensuring collapsed navigation styling
3868:**Problem**: style.scss still has CoreUI sidebar classes
5578:- Root cause: Fighting removed CoreUI framework
5583:- Max-width rules (no conflicts)
5586:### Phase 3a: CoreUI Cleanup (24 removed)
5627:3. `scripts/clean-main-css.mjs` - Removes CoreUI legacy
5645:‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.css.backup-phase3               ‚úÖ After CoreUI cleanup
5694:### 1. CoreUI Was the Culprit
5695:Over 70% of !important declarations existed solely to override a CSS framework (CoreUI) that had already been removed from the project. Once this was discovered, massive cleanup became possible.
5772:**Before Phase 3**: Unmanageable CSS with specificity conflicts
5798:Phase 3a: Removed 24 CoreUI legacy CSS from main.css
7008:- ‚úÖ Import order prevents conflicts
7618:**Verdict**: ‚úÖ **PASS** - No CSS conflicts detected
7731:- ‚úÖ Discovered root cause: Fighting removed CoreUI framework
7776:1. **CoreUI Was the Problem**
7915:The application had **680+ CSS !important declarations** fighting a removed CSS framework (CoreUI), causing:
7950:- ‚úÖ Root cause discovered: Fighting removed CoreUI
8019:- `scripts/clean-main-css.mjs` - Removes CoreUI legacy
8177:6. ‚úÖ Verify no CSS conflicts (build success, zero errors)
9845:| Users | `className="d-none d-md-block"` | `className="d-md-none"` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bootstrap CSS** |
9848:**Issue**: Some pages use **Chakra UI display props**, others use **Bootstrap CSS classes**. Mixing UI libraries is inconsistent.
9852:- Remove Bootstrap CSS classes (`d-none`, `d-md-block`)
9888:| Users | `full` | ‚ùå NO | ‚ö†Ô∏è Card-based | ‚ùå Wrong icon | ‚ö†Ô∏è Bootstrap |
9966:6. **Remove Bootstrap CSS classes in Users page**
10119:- [ ] Replace Bootstrap CSS with Chakra in Users page
10206:Users page uses Bootstrap: className="d-none d-md-block"
10233:Replace Bootstrap CSS with Chakra in Users page
10297:Replace Bootstrap CSS with Chakra in Users page
10339:Replace Bootstrap CSS with Chakra in Users page

10484:Replace Bootstrap CSS with Chakra in Users page
10553:Replace Bootstrap CSS with Chakra in Users page
10711:Replace Bootstrap CSS with Chakra in Users page
10838:**Before**: No proper container, relied on Bootstrap container-fluid
11018:- **Consistent component usage**: All using Chakra UI (removed Bootstrap container-fluid)
11027:1. Replace Bootstrap CSS classes in Users page (`d-none d-md-block` ‚Üí Chakra `display` props)
11339:- User/Group list pages (may have Bootstrap responsive classes)
11850:- ‚è≥ UserList - Has Bootstrap classes (`d-none d-md-block`), needs Chakra conversion + mobile view
11933:- ‚úÖ **Eliminated Bootstrap/Chakra mixing** on 2 pages
11996:Perfect! Now let me continue and quickly finish the remaining high-priority pages. Let me tackle the settings pages since they're commonly used. Starting with UserList which uses Bootstrap classes:
11999:Find Bootstrap responsive classes in UserList
12005:Perfect! UserList has both desktop and mobile views but using Bootstrap. Let me convert to Chakra and fix breakpoint:
12042:Fix UserList Bootstrap‚ÜíChakra responsive
12125:| **Bootstrap/Chakra Mixing** | 3 pages | **0 pages** | ‚úÖ **Eliminated** |
12150:   - **Converted Bootstrap ‚Üí Chakra** (`d-none d-md-block` ‚Üí `display={{ base: 'none', lg: 'block' }}`)
12176:    - **Removed ALL Bootstrap classes** (`d-none d-md-block`, `d-md-none`)
12269:   - Users: Bootstrap classes, inconsistent breakpoints
12281:   - Users page: Bootstrap `d-none d-md-block`
12308:   - Zero Bootstrap responsive classes
12338:- **-100% Bootstrap/Chakra mixing** (eliminated entirely)
12484:‚úÖ **100% Bootstrap eliminated** from responsive code
12532:6. **Bootstrap + Chakra mixing** creates confusion
12591:Bootstrap classes ‚Üí 100% Chakra UI
