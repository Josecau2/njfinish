### Overview
This checklist verifies that all UI components properly implement the manufacturer isolation and blueprint system according to the specification document.

---

## üéØ Core Business Logic Verification

### ‚úÖ 1. Gallery Isolation
- [ ] **Gallery shows only blueprints**: No manufacturer-specific modifications appear in the main gallery
- [ ] **Blueprint indicator**: Clear visual indication that items are blueprints (reusable)
- [ ] **No pricing in gallery**: Blueprint templates show no price information
- [ ] **Cross-manufacturer availability**: All blueprints available to all manufacturers

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to Settings > Global Modifications
2. Check that gallery only contains blueprints (no manufacturer-specific items)
3. Verify no price information is displayed for blueprint templates
4. Confirm all items show clear blueprint indicators

### ‚úÖ 2. Manufacturer Context Isolation
- [ ] **Manufacturer-specific views**: Each manufacturer sees only their own modifications
- [ ] **No cross-contamination**: Manufacturer A's mods never appear under Manufacturer B
- [ ] **Price display**: Manufacturer modifications show proper pricing
- [ ] **Assignment scoping**: Modifications can only be assigned within correct manufacturer context

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to Settings > Manufacturers > [Manufacturer A] > Catalog Mapping
2. Verify only Manufacturer A's modifications are shown
3. Switch to different manufacturer, verify isolation
4. Check that assignments respect manufacturer boundaries

## üî® Builder Functionality (Task 5)

### ‚úÖ 3. Manufacturer Builder Scoping
- [ ] **Manufacturer ID required**: Builder blocks creation if manufacturer context is missing
- [ ] **Blueprint checkbox available**: "Also save to Gallery as blueprint" option present
- [ ] **Clear labeling**: Checkbox has helpful explanatory text
- [ ] **Default behavior**: Creates manufacturer-specific mod by default
- [ ] **Validation feedback**: Clear error messages for missing context

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to manufacturer's catalog mapping tab
2. Try to create a modification and verify manufacturer ID is captured
3. Check that blueprint checkbox is present and functional
4. Verify validation prevents creation without manufacturer context

### ‚úÖ 4. Gallery Builder Behavior
- [ ] **Always blueprints**: Gallery builder only creates blueprint templates
- [ ] **No manufacturer assignment**: No manufacturer ID assigned to gallery-created items
- [ ] **Reusability focus**: Clear messaging about blueprint nature
- [ ] **Proper categorization**: Blueprints properly categorized in gallery

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to Settings > Global Modifications
2. Create a new modification template
3. Verify it's created as a blueprint (no manufacturer association)
4. Confirm it appears in gallery for all manufacturers

---

## üìÅ Category Management (Task 6)

- [ ] **Delete options**: Multiple delete modes available (empty, move, with mods)
- [ ] **Move templates**: Can move templates between categories during delete
- [ ] **Validation**: Proper validation prevents invalid operations
- [ ] **User feedback**: Clear success/error messages

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to category management interface
2. Edit a category (rename, reorder)
3. Attempt to delete categories with different options
4. Verify template moving works correctly
5. Check validation and error handling

### ‚úÖ 6. Scope-Aware Categories
- [ ] **Gallery categories**: Categories properly scoped to gallery
- [ ] **Manufacturer categories**: Categories properly scoped to manufacturers
- [ ] **Isolation maintained**: No cross-scope category contamination
- [ ] **Proper filtering**: Categories filtered by appropriate scope

**Test Steps:**
1. Compare category lists between gallery and manufacturer contexts
2. Verify categories maintain proper scope associations
3. Check that filtering works correctly

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Edit Modal Enhancements (Task 7)

### ‚úÖ 7. Template Edit Modals
- [ ] **Mark as Ready toggle**: Clear toggle for ready/draft status
- [ ] **Status indication**: Visual indication of current status
- [ ] **Helpful text**: Clear explanation of what "ready" means
- [ ] **Image upload preservation**: Sample images preserved during edits
- [ ] **Field validation**: Proper validation of required fields

**Test Steps:**
1. Edit an existing modification template
2. Toggle the "Mark as Ready" status
3. Upload/change sample images
4. Verify all fields are properly preserved
5. Check validation feedback

### ‚úÖ 8. Consistent UI Patterns
- [ ] **Consistent toggles**: Same toggle pattern across different edit modals
- [ ] **Unified styling**: Consistent visual design
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Proper labels and descriptions
- [ ] **Mobile responsive**: Works on different screen sizes

**Test Steps:**
1. Test edit modals in both gallery and manufacturer contexts
2. Check visual consistency across different pages
3. Test on mobile/tablet screen sizes
4. Verify accessibility features

## üîÑ Data Integrity UI Feedback

### ‚úÖ 9. Validation Messages
- [ ] **Blueprint validation**: Clear messages for blueprint rule violations
- [ ] **Manufacturer validation**: Clear messages for manufacturer rule violations
- [ ] **Price validation**: Appropriate price validation for different contexts
- [ ] **User-friendly errors**: Technical errors translated to user-friendly messages

**Test Steps:**
1. Try to create invalid combinations (blueprint with manufacturer, etc.)
2. Verify error messages are clear and actionable
3. Check that validation happens at appropriate times (real-time vs submit)

### ‚úÖ 10. Visual Indicators
- [ ] **Blueprint badges**: Clear visual indicators for blueprints
- [ ] **Status badges**: Clear indicators for ready/draft status
- [ ] **Manufacturer associations**: Clear indicators of manufacturer ownership
- [ ] **Category scoping**: Visual distinction between gallery and manufacturer categories

**Test Steps:**
1. Review visual indicators across all interfaces
2. Verify badges and indicators are consistent
3. Check that status is always clearly visible
