I've restored the critical fixes:
✅ CatalogTable.js - Added exposedOptions constant
✅ PageHeader.jsx - Added rightContent prop support
✅ ManufacturersList.jsx - Fixed edit route path
✅ Audit route - Fixed manifest import
✅ Build passes - No errors
✅ Changes committed
All the key functional fixes from the previous session before the scripts disaster are now restored. The app builds successfully.
