### Session: Layout Consistency & Responsive Fixes (continued)

27. **Established standard page layout patterns**
    - What needs to be fixed: Inconsistent container sizes, toolbar and empty-state patterns across pages.
    - How it can be fixed: Define and apply three standard container sizes (List/Table ‚Üí `maxW=7xl`, Narrow/Form ‚Üí `maxW=6xl`, Settings ‚Üí `maxW=container.xl`). Standardized toolbar and empty-state patterns (icons sized 48px matching PageHeader, toolbar with `Box flex={1} maxW="520px"`).
    - Result: Fewer layout variations and a documented pattern library for future pages.

28. **Filter Buttons Pattern added to list pages**
    - What needs to be fixed: Missing status filter UI on Orders and other list pages.
    - How it can be fixed: Implement a reusable filter buttons pattern (HStack of Buttons, size `sm`, solid/outline variants for selected state) and apply to Payments, Proposals, Orders.
    - Result: Consistent filtering UX across list pages and improved discoverability.

29. **Toolbar pattern standardized**
    - What needs to be fixed: Inconsistent search bar layouts and counts display across pages.
    - How it can be fixed: Standardize to a Flex with left search box (wrapped in `Box flex={1} maxW="520px"`) and right-side actions/count in an HStack.
    - Result: Uniform toolbar layout and predictable responsive behavior.

30. **Empty state pattern enforced**
    - What needs to be fixed: Many pages used a generic Search icon for empty states.
    - How it can be fixed: Replace incorrect icons (e.g., Orders/Search) with page-appropriate icons (Orders ‚Üí ShoppingCart, Users ‚Üí Users) sized to 48px and aligned to PageHeader icon.
    - Result: Clearer, consistent empty states across the app.

31. **Standard responsive strategy (tables ‚Üí mobile cards)**
    - What needs to be fixed: Wide tables caused horizontal scrolling on mobile/tablet.
    - How it can be fixed: Implement a desktop/tablet breakpoint strategy using `display={{ base: 'none', lg: 'block' }}` for tables and `display={{ base: 'flex', lg: 'none' }}` with `VStack`/`Card` for mobile card views; change breakpoints from `md` to `lg` to ensure tablets show cards.
    - Result: Eliminated horizontal scrolling on major pages (Orders, Payments, Proposals, Customers, Leads, Contractors, Users) and improved mobile usability.

32. **Bootstrap ‚Üí Chakra migration for responsive code**
    - What needs to be fixed: Mixed use of Bootstrap responsive classes (e.g., `d-none d-md-block`) caused inconsistency.
    - How it can be fixed: Convert Bootstrap markup to Chakra `Box`/display props (`display={{ base: 'none', lg: 'block' }}`) and remove class-based toggles.
    - Result: All responsive behavior now uses Chakra props, reducing library mixing and increasing consistency.

33. **Added containers to pages missing wrappers**
    - What needs to be fixed: Pages like GlobalModsPage and TermsPage had no consistent container and relied on fluid layout.
    - How it can be fixed: Wrap content with Chakra `Container` using `container.xl` for settings pages.
    - Result: Settings pages now have proper max-width and padding.

34. **Mobile card views added for wide-table pages**
    - What needs to be fixed: LeadsPage (8 columns), Contractors, Customers required mobile card implementations.
    - How it can be fixed: Add `VStack` + `Card` mobile layouts showing key fields, badges, and actions (select + details) while keeping full table for desktop.
    - Result: Leads page fixed (no horizontal scroll); Contractors and Customers adjusted to use `lg` breakpoint.

35. **Orders page overhaul**
    - What needs to be fixed: Missing filters, wrong empty icon, inconsistent toolbar and container.
    - How it can be fixed: Add status filter buttons, replace empty state icon with `ShoppingCart`, wrap search in `Box flex={1} maxW="520px"`, standardize container to `maxW="7xl"` and add mobile cards.
    - Result: Orders now matches Payments UX and is fully responsive.

36. **Users page overhaul**
    - What needs to be fixed: Bootstrap responsive classes and wrong empty state icon.
    - How it can be fixed: Convert Bootstrap classes to Chakra display props, replace empty state icon with `Users` (48px), standardize breakpoints, and ensure mobile cards display correctly.
    - Result: Admin users UI is now consistent and responsive.

37. **Contracts page responsive fix**
    - What needs to be fixed: Contracts page had a manual view toggle but no responsive behavior; mobile users experienced horizontal scrolling.
    - How it can be fixed: Keep the manual view toggle for user preference but add responsive display props so mobile (<1024px) automatically shows the card view; ensure empty-state icon uses Briefcase to match PageHeader.
    - Result: Contracts page no longer scrolls horizontally on mobile; build verified successful.

38. **OrderDetails and other detail pages: plan and next actions**
    - What needs to be fixed: Identified wide content and tables in OrderDetails, Contract detail tabs, and other pages.
    - How it can be fixed/planned: Add responsive wrappers or simplified mobile layouts (cards/accordions) as appropriate; these were queued as high-priority fixes in the remaining work list.
    - Result: Plan documented in `REMAINING-INCONSISTENCIES.md` for follow-up.

39. **Verification: frequent builds and checks**
    - What needs to be fixed: Ensured no breaking changes introduced during refactors.
    - How it can be fixed: Run production `vite build` after batches of changes; fix a JSX mismatched tag error in `UserList.jsx` (changed `</div>` to `</Box>`) encountered during conversion.
    - Result: Builds passed (examples: 19.14s, 18.94s, 17.95s across sessions) with successful verification after each major batch.

40. **Documentation produced and updated**
    - What needs to be fixed: Lack of documentation for the new standards and the work performed.
    - How it can be fixed: Write detailed docs and reports: `CONSISTENCY-FIXES-APPLIED.md`, `COMPREHENSIVE-INCONSISTENCY-REPORT.md`, `RESPONSIVE-FIXES-IN-PROGRESS.md`, `ALL-CONSISTENCY-FIXES-COMPLETE.md`, `FINAL-FIX-SUMMARY.md`, `REMAINING-INCONSISTENCIES.md`.
    - Result: Full audit trail and playbook for future contributors.

41. **Files modified (high level) ‚Äî tracked and verified**
    - What needs to be fixed: Key files with inconsistent layout/behavior.
    - How it can be fixed: Edit only affected React page files to apply the patterns above.
    - Notable files changed in these sessions: `frontend/src/pages/orders/OrdersList.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/payments/PaymentsList.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/proposals/Proposals.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/settings/users/UserList.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/settings/globalMods/GlobalModsPage.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/settings/terms/TermsPage.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/admin/LeadsPage.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/admin/Contractors.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/customers/Customers.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/contracts/index.jsx`, and several documentation files.

42. **Remaining items (documented, queued)**
    - What remains: A small set of pages still needing mobile views or container standardization: `OrderDetails.jsx`, `LocationList.jsx`, `UserGroupList.jsx`, and a few form/detail pages.
    - How it will be fixed: Use the same responsive table ‚Üí card pattern and standard container sizes; estimated ~2‚Äì3 hours for final pass (documented in `REMAINING-INCONSISTENCIES.md`).
    - Result: Plan and priority list created for next session.

End of continuation from conversation.md (lines 10000‚Äì20000).

### Continuation: fixes and verifications (from conversation.md lines 20000‚Äì30000)

43. **Fixed Chakra prop syntax errors across the frontend**
    - What needs to be fixed: Many Chakra component props were accidentally converted to object syntax (e.g., `fontSize: 'sm'`) which caused JSX/transform errors.
    - How it can be fixed: Create and run scripts (`fix-chakra-prop-syntax.js`, `fix-all-prop-syntax.js`) to convert prop-style usages back to Chakra prop syntax (e.g., `fontSize="sm"`) while preserving style object usages. Manually correct edge cases where automated regex missed multi-line props.
    - Result: 457 prop syntax fixes applied across ~77 files; build errors due to this issue resolved.

44. **Fixed style-object fontSize syntax errors**
    - What needs to be fixed: The initial typography script also replaced prop-style fontSize attributes with object-style syntax in some places, breaking JSX.
    - How it can be fixed: Write `fix-all-font-size-errors.js` and target remaining `fontSize:` occurrences that were not inside `style={{}}` blocks, and adjust theme files back to object syntax where appropriate.
    - Result: Nine additional fixes applied to theme and component files; build progressed further.

45. **Iterative build-debug loop to resolve remaining transform errors**
    - What needs to be fixed: Multiple remaining transform errors (fontSize mis-syntax) surfaced in files like `AppBreadcrumb.jsx`, `Contracts/index.jsx`, `theme/index.js`, and `EditManufacturer.jsx`.
    - How it can be fixed: Repeatedly run the frontend build (`npx vite build`) to get specific error locations, read the failing files, and apply targeted edits (both automated scripts and small manual fixes) until build errors cleared.
    - Result: Build iterations transformed progressively more modules and ultimately completed successfully multiple times (example final builds around ~17‚Äì20s).

46. **Resolved large-scale prop conversion side-effects**
    - What needs to be fixed: Automated regex replacements produced mixed results‚Äîsome fontSize/color fixes belonged inside JS style objects and some as Chakra props.
    - How it can be fixed: Implement conservative, context-aware scripts that detect `style={{` blocks and JSX prop contexts, and selectively convert only the correct occurrences.
    - Result: Reduced false-positive edits and stabilized the codebase for further build verification.

47. **Created and ran recovery scripts when shell command limits were hit**
    - What needs to be fixed: Some attempts to run shell-based `grep`/`sed` chains hit buffer/command-size limits on Windows, causing ENOBUFS and similar errors.
    - How it can be fixed: Rework some file-finding logic into Node scripts (avoid spawning large shell pipelines) and limit grep output size; use targeted sed fixes for specific files when safe.
    - Result: Recovery scripts ran reliably across Windows environment without spawning huge commands.

48. **Fixed OrdersList runtime ReferenceError (getPaymentStatus hoisting)**
    - What needs to be fixed: Runtime error 'Cannot access getPaymentStatus before initialization' in `OrdersList.jsx` due to functions being defined after a useMemo that called them.
    - How it can be fixed: Move `getOrderPayment` and `getPaymentStatus` function definitions above the `useMemo` block, remove duplicate definitions, and use the more complete implementation (including `paidAt`).
    - Result: OrdersList runtime error resolved; dev server and app rendering regained stability.

49. **Comprehensively fixed font-size/color conversions and re-ran build**
    - What needs to be fixed: After multiple targeted edits, final large-scale conversion results were reconciled with theme and style object expectations.
    - How it can be fixed: Combine automated scripts and manual edits, re-run build checks, and fix remaining syntax issues in theme files and component style blocks.
    - Result: Full production build success reported several times (e.g., "‚úì built in 16.61s").

50. **Addressed scrollbar and double-scroll issues**
    - What needs to be fixed: Double scrollbar on main screen caused by both body/html and inner app containers scrolling.
    - How it can be fixed: Update `DefaultLayout.jsx` to make the outer container `overflow="hidden"` and the main content area `h="100vh"` with `overflow="auto"`; add minimal, modern scrollbar styling in `main.css` and ensure `html, body, #root` overflow rules are consistent.
    - Result: Single scrolling container restored; scrollbars styled consistently across the app.

51. **Created COMPREHENSIVE-AUDIT.md and a prioritized remediation plan**
    - What needs to be fixed: Lack of single-source audit and prioritized action list.
    - How it can be fixed: Generate a 700+ line audit including app purpose, routes, critical issues (breakpoints, mobile tables, tap targets), and an implementation roadmap with estimates.
    - Result: Clear backlog and priorities; file committed as `COMPREHENSIVE-AUDIT.md`.

52. **Bulk breakpoint normalization (768px ‚Üí 1024px / md‚Üílg alignment)**
    - What needs to be fixed: Mixed use of 768px (md) and 1024px (lg) breakpoints causing inconsistent responsive behavior.
    - How it can be fixed: Run controlled replacements and targeted edits in `main.css`, `responsive.css`, `CalendarView.css`, `ManufacturerSelect.css`, and inlined styles in React files to align to Chakra's `lg` (1024px) standard. Adjust `min-width`/`max-width` ranges as appropriate.
    - Result: Breakpoint consistency restored, sidebar and content collapse behavior aligned; build verified successful.

53. **Generated FIXES-PROGRESS.md to track work and status**
    - What needs to be fixed: Need for ongoing progress tracking.
    - How it can be fixed: Create `FIXES-PROGRESS.md` summarizing completed fixes, in-progress tasks (mobile table strategy), pending tasks (tap targets, skeletons, error boundaries), build status, and testing checklist.
    - Result: Central progress file created and updated.

54. **Started mobile-table (table‚Üícard) implementation plan**
    - What needs to be fixed: Tables overflowing on narrow viewports and inconsistent mobile UX.
    - How it can be fixed: Draft a reusable implementation template (Table view for lg+, VStack/Card view for base‚Üílg) and list affected pages (Customers, Orders, Payments, Proposals, Users, Locations, Contractors) for phased implementation.
    - Result: Mobile card plan staged; work queued in todos for implementation.

55. **Prepared tap-target audit and remediation approach**
    - What needs to be fixed: Potential undersized touch targets (<44√ó44px) for IconButtons and action controls on mobile.
    - How it can be fixed: Document a plan to run an automated check and apply `size="lg"` or `minW/minH="44px"` to IconButtons and critical controls; note ARIA-label additions.
    - Result: Plan documented; ticket created in FIXES-PROGRESS.md.

56. **Standardized loading states recommendation**
    - What needs to be fixed: Inconsistent loading indicators across the app.
    - How it can be fixed: Recommend and document replacing ad-hoc spinners with Chakra Skeleton patterns and a consistent LoadingFallback component for lazy routes.
    - Result: Standardization plan included in audit; queued in todos.

57. **Planned page-level ErrorBoundary adoption**
    - What needs to be fixed: Single root ErrorBoundary causing whole-app crashes on single-component failures.
    - How it can be fixed: Wrap routes and critical sections with localized ErrorBoundaries and retry/fallback UIs; document fallback pattern.
    - Result: Plan documented and queued.

58. **Addressed Windows shell limitations in automation tooling**
    - What needs to be fixed: Some shell-heavy scripts (`grep|sed|xargs`) hit Windows process buffer limits.
    - How it can be fixed: Convert large pipeline tasks to Node-based file scanners and editors, and use narrower sed/gawk calls for single-file fixes.
    - Result: Automation runs became reliable on Windows developer environments.

59. **Fixed miscellaneous live runtime issues surfaced by builds and dev server**
    - What needs to be fixed: Minor runtime or JSX issues introduced during edits (e.g., mismatched tags, accidental whitespace) and edge-case logic bugs.
    - How it can be fixed: Use iterative build feedback, locate exact failing lines, and apply targeted code edits to fix syntax/logic; re-run builds and dev server to confirm.
    - Result: Clean builds and stable dev server output; multiple successful production builds recorded.

60. **Verified dev and build servers, and started frontend dev server for live checks**
    - What needs to be fixed: Need for programmatic verification beyond static builds.
    - How it can be fixed: Launch frontend dev server (`npx vite --host --port 3000`) and monitor logs; confirm routes and initial loading are reachable.
    - Result: Local dev server running; manual and programmatic checks possible for visual verification.

61. **Created remediation priority roadmap and estimated effort**
    - What needs to be fixed: Lack of time/effort estimates for remaining work
    - How it can be fixed: Add effort estimates and a priority matrix in `COMPREHENSIVE-AUDIT.md` with immediate, short-term, and long-term tasks.
    - Result: Clear plan for next sprints and resource planning.

62. **Queued follow-up items and tests**
    - What needs to be fixed: Remaining mobile-table implementations, tap-target remediation, Skeleton adoption, ErrorBoundary roll-out, modal full-screen behavior,
    - How it can be fixed: Add all follow-ups to the todo list and document required testing checklist (breakpoint tests, device tests, Lighthouse/a11y checks).
    - Result: Todos updated; `FIXES-PROGRESS.md` and `COMPREHENSIVE-AUDIT.md` reference next steps.

### Continuation: optimizations, auth pages conversion, and final cleanup (from conversation.md lines 30000‚Äì40000)

63. **Bundle analysis and vendor chunking completed**
    - What needs to be fixed: Large main bundle and unoptimized vendor mixing that hurt caching and initial load.
    - How it can be fixed: Update `frontend/vite.config.mjs` to extract Chakra UI and PDF-related libraries into separate vendor chunks (`chakra-vendor`, `pdf-vendor`), add dynamic imports for heavy components and lazy-loaded PDF viewer.
    - Result: Main bundle reduced by ~24% (1,140 kB ‚Üí ~867 kB), vendor chunks separated (chakra ~426 kB, pdf ~386 kB), and build times remained stable.

64. **Created automated accessibility test suite (Playwright + Axe)**
    - What needs to be fixed: Lack of automated accessibility checks across critical routes.
    - How it can be fixed: Add `tests/accessibility.spec.js` with Playwright + Axe checks for Login, Dashboard, Customers, Proposals, Orders, and Payments (WCAG 2.1 AA scoped tests + keyboard navigation and color contrast checks).
    - Result: Automated a11y tests available for CI and local verification.

65. **Added lazy-loading script for images (then reverted/fixed)**
    - What needs to be fixed: Missing lazy loading on large images hurting FCP.
    - How it can be fixed: Write `scripts/add-lazy-loading.mjs` to add `loading="lazy"` to <img> tags; discover the naive implementation produces malformed tags and revert the broken changes, then correct the approach.
    - Result: Script safely updated and re-run on a controlled set of files; lazy loading applied where safe (8 files modified initially) after fixes.

66. **Fixed duplicate JSX attributes causing esbuild transform errors**
    - What needs to be fixed: Duplicate `size` attributes in `AppSidebar.js` and `ManuMultipliers.jsx` causing build failures.
    - How it can be fixed: Locate duplicate attributes, remove extras, and verify JSX validity.
    - Result: Build error cleared and subsequent builds proceeded.

67. **Repaired lazy-loading malformation**
    - What needs to be fixed: `loading="lazy"` accidentally placed after `/>` causing a parse error.
    - How it can be fixed: Revert the malformed commits and re-apply lazy loading via a safer script, ensuring attributes are inserted before the closing bracket.
    - Result: No more parse errors and safe lazy loading applied.

68. **Bundle re-analysis and final vendor distribution**
    - What needs to be fixed: Need to validate that vendor chunking achieved intended cache and size goals.
    - How it can be fixed: Run `scripts/analyze-bundle.mjs` and update chunking rules; confirm vendor chunks are ~38.8% of total and main decreased.
    - Result: Fewer chunks (98 ‚Üí 75), improved caching and 24% main bundle reduction.

69. **Completed CSS conflict resolution for auth pages and 50/50 split**
    - What needs to be fixed: Authentication pages had conflicting CSS, duplicates, and incorrect class names leading to broken layout.
    - How it can be fixed: Remove duplicate/conflicting rules in `main.css`/`responsive.css`, fix `className="login-form-"` typos to `login-form-container`, apply consistent `flex:1 + max-width:50%` rules, and remove media-query overrides that forced fixed right-panel widths.
    - Result: Login, Request Access, Forgot Password, and Reset Password pages now have equal 50/50 split on desktop and proper stacked behavior on mobile.

70. **Converted auth pages to Chakra UI for consistent layout and to remove Bootstrap conflicts**
    - What needs to be fixed: Bootstrap/CoreUI imports conflicted with custom CSS; mobile alignment and inconsistent spacing persisted.
    - How it can be fixed: Rewrite `LoginPage.jsx`, `ForgotPasswordPage.jsx`, `ResetPasswordPage.jsx`, and `RequestAccessPage.jsx` to Chakra components (Flex, Box, Container, VStack, SimpleGrid, FormControl, etc.), preserve all original logic, translations, and API calls, and use 1024px (`lg`) breakpoint for desktop behavior.
    - Result: Clean Chakra-based auth pages with consistent spacing, centered content, proper containers (md/lg), and no Bootstrap cascade conflicts.

71. **Auth pages: focused mobile tuning and spacing fixes**
    - What needs to be fixed: Logo centering, form spacing, and overly large gaps on mobile.
    - How it can be fixed: Ensure Container px/py tuned for base and lg breakpoints, set minH on inputs/buttons (44/48px), adjust VStack spacing, tighten Request Access form vertical rhythm (mb spacing and grid gaps), and hide left branding panel below lg.
    - Result: Compact, touch-friendly mobile forms with centered logos and consistent button sizing.

72. **Replaced Bootstrap-based auth CSS with a clean auth stylesheet (fallback)**
    - What needs to be fixed: Residual Bootstrap overrides in `main.css` created inconsistent rules and forced !important usage.
    - How it can be fixed: Create `frontend/src/styles/auth.css` (clean auth-only styles) and remove redundant Bootstrap overrides from `main.css`, then migrate pages to Chakra-based structure; keep `auth.css` as a minimal fallback for non-Chakra auth pieces.
    - Result: No more Bootstrap conflicts in auth pages; styles are deterministic and localized.

73. **Addressed RequestAccessPage spacing and mobile layout (tightened spacing)**
    - What needs to be fixed: RequestAccessPage form fields were too far apart on mobile and desktop, creating an unpleasant vertical rhythm.
    - How it can be fixed: Reduce per-field spacing in Chakra stacks (spacing={4} ‚Üí spacing={3} for compact sections), use SimpleGrid with smaller gaps for dense fields, reduce textarea rows and font sizes on mobile, and use Container maxW="lg" only for desktop.
    - Result: More compact, readable Request Access form on mobile and desktop without losing accessibility or touch targets.

74. **Performed multiple iterative builds and dev-server checks to validate changes**
    - What needs to be fixed: Need to ensure conversion didn't break downstream components or builds.
    - How it can be fixed: Run dev server for live checks, run production builds (`vite build`) after conversions, and fix minor JSX/attribute issues discovered (e.g., missing imports or mismatched tags).
    - Result: Successful builds (examples: 19.8s, 20.7s) and dev server running for visual verification.

75. **Final documentation updates and audit markings**
    - What needs to be fixed: Audit needed to reflect bundle, accessibility, lazy-loading, and auth-page conversions.
    - How it can be fixed: Update `COMPREHENSIVE-AUDIT.md`, add `AUDIT-COMPLETION-REPORT.md`, and insert new sections describing vendor chunking, Playwright tests, lazy-loading caveats, and auth conversions.
    - Result: Audit and completion report reflect final state and recommended next steps.

76. **Performance verifications and FCP considerations**
    - What needs to be fixed: Ensure optimizations yield measurable improvements on page load.
    - How it can be fixed: Measure bundle sizes and recommend lazy-loading for images, dynamic imports for heavy components (PDF viewer), and adding Chakra to vendor chunks.
    - Result: Main bundle reduced and vendor caching improved; recommended next steps for FCP improvements recorded.

77. **Removed Bootstrap overrides and CoreUI leftovers from auth styling**
    - What needs to be fixed: Residual CoreUI/Bootstrap styles previously overriding auth layout.
    - How it can be fixed: Identify import order and remove or isolate CoreUI overrides; ensure `auth.css` and Chakra components control auth page presentation.
    - Result: Deterministic auth page styling and simplified CSS cascade.

78. **Ensured accessibility and touch-target compliance on auth pages**
    - What needs to be fixed: Input/button sizes and ARIA concerns.
    - How it can be fixed: Set minH/minW for inputs and buttons, ensure error/notification alerts used Chakra Alert for semantic roles, and preserve ARIA-live statuses for notice messages.
    - Result: Auth pages meet tap-target and basic a11y expectations; included in Playwright a11y tests.

79. **Queued final polish items (low risk) into REMAINING-INCONSISTENCIES.md**
    - What needs to be fixed: Minor layout/spacing edge cases observed during QA.
    - How it can be fixed: Document small items (logo centering tweaks for very small screens, tiny spacing adjustments in RequestAccess form, optional dark mode tuning) to track as follow-ups.
    - Result: Small TODOs tracked for a lighter follow-up pass.

80. **Session outcome: Full conversion of auth flows to Chakra, bundle optimization, and audit updates**
    - What needs to be fixed: Inconsistent auth pages, large main bundle, and missing test coverage.
    - How it can be fixed: Convert auth pages to Chakra, split vendor chunks, add automated a11y tests, and document final state.
    - Result: Application builds successfully, auth pages are responsive and consistent, and audit files reflect the completed work.

### Continuation: card normalization, migration scripts, and final verification (conversation.md lines 40000‚Äì55000)

81. **Bulk migration: Card ‚Üí StandardCard across 43 files**
    - What needs to be fixed: Many pages used raw Chakra `Card` with inconsistent props leading to visual inconsistencies.
    - How it can be fixed: Write and run `migrate-cards.mjs` to replace `Card` usages with the project's `StandardCard` wrapper and adjust imports; migration reports 43 successful file updates.

82. **Repaired malformed JSX introduced by naive migration**
    - What needs to be fixed: The initial automated replacement produced malformed tags like `<,>` and `<,Body>` which caused build parse errors.
    - How it can be fixed: Create `fix-card-migration.mjs` to repair broken tags (CardHeader/CardBody/CardFooter) and restore valid JSX syntax; apply fixes across the affected files.

83. **Repaired identifier corruption from automated edits**
    - What needs to be fixed: Automated replacements accidentally inserted commas into variable/identifier names (e.g., `modern,Style`, `stat,s`) which broke JS syntax.
    - How it can be fixed: Implement `fix-broken-identifiers.mjs` to rename corrupted identifiers (e.g., `modernCardStyle`, `stats`) and update usages; manually review dashboard and contractor files.

84. **Fixed broken imports caused by replacements**
    - What needs to be fixed: Some imports became malformed (e.g., `import {, CardBody,`), causing build-time syntax errors.
    - How it can be fixed: Run `fix-broken-imports.mjs` to normalize import lines (`import { CardBody, CardHeader, ... }`) and re-run builds until import-related errors cleared.

85. **Repaired corrupted icon/component names (final cleanup)**
    - What needs to be fixed: Icon and component names were truncated by replacements (for example `CreditCard` ‚Üí `Credit,`, `ContactInfo` ‚Üí `ContactInfo,`).
    - How it can be fixed: Write `fix-final-issues.mjs` and apply targeted manual edits to restore correct identifiers and icon imports (e.g., `CreditCard`, `ContactInfo`, `ContactInfoCard`), then recompile.

86. **Iterative build-and-fix loop until green**
    - What needs to be fixed: Multiple build failures surfaced after bulk changes (unexpected tokens, missing identifiers, malformed tags).
    - How it can be fixed: Repeat pattern: run `npm run build:frontend`, read failing file lines, apply targeted fixes (scripts + manual edits), and re-run builds until success; final successful builds reported (examples: 17.17s and later 23.66s).

87. **Verified wide adoption of StandardCard**
    - What needs to be fixed: Ensure the migration resulted in consistent usage across the codebase.
    - How it can be fixed: Search project and confirm 63 files now import `StandardCard`; spot-check components and adjust any missing imports (e.g., `ContactInfoCard`).

88. **Normalized mobile card spacing to playbook standard**
    - What needs to be fixed: Some mobile card lists still used spacing other than the playbook's `spacing={4}` (e.g., `spacing={3}`).
    - How it can be fixed: Update pages (PaymentsList, LeadsPage, contracts/index, LocationList) to `spacing={4}` on mobile `VStack`s so all mobile card lists follow Step 8.2 of the UI playbook.

89. **Automated migration tooling (created then removed)**
    - What needs to be fixed: Need repeatable, reversible tooling to migrate hundreds of occurrences safely.
    - How it can be fixed: Create helper scripts (`migrate-cards.mjs`, `fix-card-migration.mjs`, `fix-broken-identifiers.mjs`, `fix-broken-imports.mjs`, `fix-final-issues.mjs`) to perform bulk edits and repair steps, then remove the temporary scripts after fixes to avoid accidental re-runs.

90. **Handled Windows shell/buffering limitations**
    - What needs to be fixed: Large shell pipelines and grep/sed chains failed on Windows due to buffer limits (ENOBUFS) during earlier automation attempts.
    - How it can be fixed: Convert heavy shell pipelines into Node-based file scanners and editors to make automation reliable on Windows; use smaller, targeted grep/sed calls when safe.

91. **Confirmed typography and theme consistency**
    - What needs to be fixed: Ensure fonts and type styles did not diverge when replacing Card wrappers.
    - How it can be fixed: Verify `StandardCard` relies on Chakra theme inheritance for typography. Perform spot checks and do not find font overrides on cards ‚Äî typography remains consistent via the theme.

92. **Audit updates and documentation markings**
    - What needs to be fixed: Need to reflect card normalization work in the project's audit docs.
    - How it can be fixed: Edit `COMPREHENSIVE-AUDIT.md` to mark card/tile normalization as complete, add sections summarizing the migration, and include verification checks.

93. **Multiple build & dev-server verifications**
    - What needs to be fixed: Verify code compiles and app runs without runtime errors after migration.
    - How it can be fixed: Repeat `npm run build:frontend` and restart dev servers (`node index.js`) to confirm builds succeed and dev servers run with no runtime errors; monitor logs for failures.

94. **Clean-up: removed temporary scripts and validated no raw Card imports remain**
    - What needs to be fixed: Prevent re-introduction of the faulty migration toolchain and ensure raw Chakra Card usage was removed.
    - How it can be fixed: Delete the migration/fix scripts and grep the codebase to confirm there are no remaining `import .* Card,` usages; confirm results and count StandardCard imports.

95. **Final verification and completion**
    - What needs to be fixed: Ensure card/tile consistency (styles, sizes, corners, spacing, typography) across the app and confirm stable builds.
    - How it can be fixed: Systematic migration, automated repairs, manual fixes, and multiple full builds + dev-server checks. Result: consistent StandardCard usage across pages, successful production builds, and dev servers running without errors.
